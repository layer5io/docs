<!-- 
  This shortcode is used to embed a Meshery design into hugo sites 
  Meshery Design Embedding allows exporting a design as an interactive component 
  that integrates seamlessly into websites, blogs, or any platform supporting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
  This embedded design is interactive, making it easier for infrastructure stakeholders 
  to visualize, explore, and collaborate on service mesh designs.
  
  -- Usage: 
  {{/*< meshery-design-embed src="path/to/embed.js" id="unique-id" style="custom-styles" >*/}}

<!-- 
  Retrieve the path to the JavaScript file generated for embedding the Meshery design.
  This script is generated when exporting a design from kanvas.new.
  The `src` attribute specifies the script location, as provided by the user. 
-->
{{ $script := .Get "src" }}

<!-- 
  Retrieve the unique ID for the embedded Meshery design. 
  This ID is typically generated when creating the embed code and is used to uniquely 
  identify the container for the embedded design on the page.
-->
{{ $id := .Get "id" }}

<!-- 
  Retrieve optional custom styles for the embedding container.
  If not provided, a default style will be applied to ensure proper rendering. 
-->
{{ $style := .Get "style" }}

<!-- 
  Embedding Container: 
  A `div` element is dynamically created with the provided or default styles. 
  - The `id` attribute links to the unique design embed.
  - The `style` attribute can be customized or fall back to a default appearance, 
    which includes:
      - Height: 30rem
      - Width: 100% (responsive to container width)
      - Border: 1px solid #eee (light border for visibility)
-->
<div
    id="{{ $id }}"
    {{ if $style }}
    style="{{ $style }}"
    {{ else }}
    style="height: 30rem; width: 100%; border: 1px solid #eee"
    {{ end }}
></div>

<!-- 
  Embed Script: 
  The JavaScript file (retrieved from the `src` attribute) is included here.
  - The `type="module"` ensures the script runs in a modern ES6 module context.
-->
<script src="{{ $script }}" type="module"></script>

{{< alert title="Organization owners as entitlements" >}}
It's essential to understand that owners are not roles, but entitlements.

Organization owners carry the organization administrator role, and may be joined in their organization administration duties by any number of other users carrying the organization administrator role. However, the organization owner also has the administrative privilege to delete the organization.

The entitlement of "organization owner" is automatically bestowed to the creator of a organization. The individual user who created a given organization initially is therefore granted certain administrative privileges beyond that of other organization administrators. Specifically, organization owners retain the sole permission to delete the organization.

For more information, see [Organization](/cloud/identity/organizations).

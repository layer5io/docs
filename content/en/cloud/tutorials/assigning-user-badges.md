Layer5 badges are one of the many ways that we recognize the efforts of our contributors and uplift our users. Layer5 badges represent milestones that you achieve both in using and in contributing to Layer5-supported open source projects. As a contributor, this is how you demonstrate your ownership, dedication, skills and loyalty to Layer5. As a user, this is how you demonstrate your prowess.

### How to Earn Badges

Earning Layer5 badges is both rewarding and straightforward. Each badge is tied to specific activities. For users, badges for activities such as using our projects, talking about the projects, sharing your successes and what you like about them. For contributors, badges include activities such as submitting code, assisting with documentation, participating in community events, and more. As you accumulate contributions in various areas, you'll begin to unlock badges that showcase your multifaceted involvement.

These badges will be prominently displayed on your Layer5 community profile, visually representing your journey as a contributor. Not only does this serve as a source of personal pride, but it also helps others in the community recognize your expertise and dedication.

Project Badges are assigned by the admin to the user when a user contributes to a particular project. Achievement Badges are the badges that are assigned automatically when a user completes a task like sharing a design, creating a design for the first time, etc.

**Welcome, developers!**

This guide is for technical contributors who want to build and improve the Layer5 Academy platform. If you're interested in fixing bugs, adding new features, or customizing the underlying theme, you've come to the right place.

**This section covers essential topics for contributors:**

* Multi-Repository Model: An overview of the different repositories that make up the platform, such as `academy-theme` and `academy-build`.
* Local Development: Workflows for making changes to both content and the theme on your local machine.
* End-to-End Testing: How to use the Layer5 Cloud staging environment to test your changes.
* Contribution Best Practices: Guidelines and best practices for writing clean code and submitting contributions.

Thank you for contributing to the platform!

## Exploring the Content Catalog

Your journey begins at the Academy's main catalog page, where you can discover all available learning content.

### Navigating the Catalog

First you will see a collection of content cards. Each card gives you a quick overview of learning content, including the type, its title, the number of courses it contains, and its difficulty level.

### Understanding Content Types

To help you choose the right content for your goals, we offer three distinct types. You can use the Content Type filter on the left to narrow your search.

1. **Learning Path**: Choose this when you want to systematically learn a new subject from start to finish. It's a comprehensive curriculum designed to build your knowledge from the ground up.

2. **Certification**: Choose this when you already have the knowledge and want to formally prove your skills. It focuses on assessment and evaluation through exams.

3. **Challenge**: Choose this when you want a hands-on, practical task to solve a specific problem, often in a competitive scenario.

## Starting Your Learning Journey

Once you've found a content that interests you, it's time to begin.

### Enrolling in a learning path

The content detail page gives you a full overview of what you'll learn. To start, simply click the "Enroll Now" button.

**Why enroll?**

Enrolling is a key step because it allows the Academy to track your progress. Once enrolled, the system will remember where you left off, mark your completed content, and save your quiz results, so you can always pick up right where you were.

### The Learning Interface

After enrolling, you'll be taken to the main learning interface. This is where you'll spend most of your time.

![Learning Interface Overview](./images/page-overview.png)

We've designed it to be simple and intuitive. Think of it in three parts:

1. **Your Learning Map (Left Sidebar)**: This is the complete outline of your course. It shows where you are currently positioned.

2. **Your Study Area (Center Panel)**: This is where the core content—text, images, and videos—is displayed.

3. **Discover More (Right Sidebar)**: Here, you can find tags and categories across all the content, helping you discover other relevant content in the Academy. You can click to see all related content.

After finishing a course, check out the **Tags** and **Categories** on the right. They are a great way to discover other related topics that might interest you.

## Testing Your Knowledge

Assessments are an integral part of the learning process, designed to reinforce your knowledge.

### How to Take a Quiz

By default, assessments in a Learning Path are mandatory. This creates a structured progression where you must pass the assessment for one section (like a Course) before unlocking the next. Passing an assessment marks that section as complete.

Some assessments may be marked as **Optional**. You can take these for extra practice, but you are not required to pass them to advance. 

### Answering Questions and Scoring

When you encounter an assessment, you'll see a clean interface with questions and answer options.

**Answering**: Select your answer(s) by clicking the corresponding radio button (for single-choice) or checkbox (for multiple-choice). For short-answer questions, type your response directly into the text field.

If you're ever unsure about a concept, you can always use the Back button to revisit previous courses.

**Scoring Rules:**

- **Single-Answer**: You receive full marks for selecting the one correct option.

![Single Answer Question Example](./images/q-single-answer.png)

- **Multiple-Answer**: Scoring is strict. You must select all correct options and none of the incorrect options to earn marks. There is no partial credit.

![Multiple Answer Question Example](./images/q-multi-answer.png)

- **Short-Answer**: Your answer is compared case-insensitively, and extra spaces at the beginning or end are ignored.

![Short Answer Question Example](./images/q-short-answer.png)

**Submitting**: Once you've answered all questions, click the "Submit" button at the end of the quiz. Your results, including your score and pass/fail status, will be displayed immediately.

**If you fail**: You can retake the assessment. The system will highlight the successful parts, allowing you to precisely identify where you need improvement.

**If you pass**: Congratulations! You've successfully completed the assessment and can proceed to the next section.

## Introduction
White-labeling a logo involves customizing it to remove branding elements and make it more generic or suitable for rebranding purposes. In Figma, this process can be achieved using custom letters and design tools. This document outlines step-by-step instructions on how to white-label a logo using custom letters in Figma.

## Steps

1. **Access the Logo Design:** Open Figma and navigate to the file containing the logo design that you want to white-label.

1. **Select the Text Element:** Identify the text element within the logo design that contains the brand name or specific branding elements.

1. **Replace Text with Custom Letters:** Use the Text Tool (shortcut: <button class="kbc-button kbc-button-xs">T</button>) to select the text element. Delete the existing text and replace it with custom letters from the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/5ZwEkSJwUPitURD59YHMEN/Layer5-Designs?type=design&node-id=25126%3A7220&mode=design&t=n1b199pVzQKGxw1l-1) design file.

1. **Adjust Letter Spacing and Size:** Fine-tune the letter spacing and size to ensure consistency and readability.

1. **Modify Colors:** Customize the colors of the letters to match the desired branding scheme. Use the Fill and Stroke properties to change the color of the letters accordingly.

1. **Remove Brand-specific Elements:** Identify and remove any brand-specific elements such as logos, icons, or graphics that may be embedded within the logo design.

1. **Review and Refine:** Review the white-labeled logo design to ensure that all branding elements have been appropriately replaced or removed. Make any necessary refinements to achieve the desired result.

1. **Export the Logo:** Once satisfied with the white-labeled logo design, export it as a PNG, SVG, or other desired file format for use in branding materials, websites, or marketing collateral.

White-labeling a logo using custom letters in Figma offers flexibility and customization options for rebranding or generic branding purposes. By following the outlined steps, you can effectively modify a logo design to remove branding elements and create a white-labeled version of the logo.

### Considerations of Air-Gapped Deployments

Layer5 acknowledges the importance of air-gapped deployments and ensures content support for such environments. Content registered should be available even in the absence of internet connectivity, thus aligning with Layer5's commitment to versatile deployment scenarios.

### Monitoring Considerations

Plan for comprehensive observability across your Layer5 Cloud deployment, including metrics, logs, tracing, dashboards, and alerting. Establish SLOs for latency, availability, and saturation; size telemetry storage appropriately; and ensure privacy and access controls for operational data.

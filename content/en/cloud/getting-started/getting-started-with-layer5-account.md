This guide will walk you through setting up your Layer5 account.

## Configuring your Layer5 account

The first steps in starting with Layer5 are to create an account, verify your email, setup an organization and a workspace, and view your profile.

 Every person who uses Layer5 Cloud has their own personal account, which can be part of multiple organizations and teams. Your personal account is your identity on Layer5 Cloud and represents you as an individual.

### 1. Creating an account

To sign up for an account on Layer5 Cloud, navigate to <https://cloud.layer5.io/signup>.
You may choose to either signup with your personal email or any of our supported OAuth providers like Github and Gmail. See "OAuth Providers" for more information.

### 2. Verifying your email address

To ensure you can use all the features in your Layer5 plan, verify your email address after signing up for a new account. For more information, see "Verifying your email address."

4. Configuring two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is an extra layer of security used when logging into websites or apps. We strongly urge you to configure 2FA for the safety of your account. For more information, see "About two-factor authentication."

Optionally, after you have configured 2FA, add a passkey to your account to enable a secure, passwordless login. For more information, see "About passkeys" and "Managing your passkeys." -->

### 3. Signing in to Layer5 Cloud

To sign in to Layer5 Cloud, navigate to <https://cloud.layer5.io/login>. Use your new credentials to sign in. In case you have signed up with OAuth provider, you will be redirected to the provider's login page.

## Create User Account

Seamlessly initiate new user accounts, ensuring a smooth onboarding process. Specify user details, such as email, and tailor their access by adding them to one or more organizations. Optionally assign roles, defining their scope within the platform. Complete the process by sending a personalized account setup email, streamlining the user's introduction to Layer5 Cloud.

### Removing Users from an Organization

You can remove users from an organization one by one or several at once. This action takes away their membership and access to that specific organization's resources but doesnâ€™t delete their overall Layer5 Cloud account.

#### Method 1: Individual User Removal (One by One)
   * **Locate the User:** Find the specific user you wish to remove from the list.
   * **Use Row Action:** Click the "Remove User" icon.
   * **Confirm:** When prompted, confirm your decision to remove the user from the organization.

#### Method 2: Bulk User Removal (Multiple Users at Once)
   * **Select Users:** Use the checkboxes next to each user's name to select all the users you intend to remove.
   * **Use Bulk Action:** Click the "Delete" button.
   * **Confirm:** When prompted, confirm that you want to remove all the selected users from the organization.

## Invite User via Email

You can invite new or existing users to join one of your organizations by sending them an email invitation.

* **How to Invite:**
    1.  Click the "Invite User" button.
    2.  Enter the person's First Name, Last Name, and Email address.
    3.  Assign them to a target Organization. Optionally, Team(s) and Organization Role(s) they will receive.
    4.  Layer5 Cloud sends an invitation email to the user.
* **What the User Does:** The person you invited will click a link in the email to accept. If they're new to Layer5 Cloud, they'll need to create an account first before they can join your organization.

An Organization Admin can assign organization roles to users, but provider roles can only be assigned by Provider Admins. For more information, see [Roles](/cloud/security/roles).

Metrics provide valuable insights into how users engage with the designs, allowing us to understand usage patterns, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve the user experience.

The design catalog can be accessed from the _Layer5 Cloud_ catalog page at [Layer5 Cloud Catalog](https://cloud.layer5.io/catalog).

Designs can be imported, exported, versioned, forked, merged, snapshotted, published, shared, embedded, templatized, and more. Learn more about [Designs](/kanvas/getting-started/)

You can view the metrics of a Design in two ways:
1. Below each Design's catalog card, you can see its metrics.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each metric we track:

##### 1. Opens
This metric helps us understand how often users are viewing a particular design.

##### 2. Downloads
Downloads provide insights into the popularity and demand for a design.

##### 3. Deploys
This metric shows how often a design is implemented or put into action. 

##### 4. Clones
Cloning metrics indicate how often users are creating copies of a design for modification or personal use.

##### 5. Shares
Shares measure the social aspect of design usage.

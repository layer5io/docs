## Why Use Comments?

### Enhance Collaboration

Comments serve as a communication channel, allowing team members to discuss specific part of a Kanvas design. Whether it's seeking feedback, asking questions, or providing clarifications, comments foster a collaborative environment.

### Streamline Design Reviews

Facilitate efficient design reviews by using comments to highlight key aspects, address concerns, and capture feedback directly within the Designer Mode. This approach ensures that discussions are contextually tied to the design, reducing the need for external communication channels.

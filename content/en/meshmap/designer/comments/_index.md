## Why Use Comments?

### Enhance Collaboration

Comments serve as a communication channel, allowing team members to discuss specific part of a MeshMap design. Whether it's seeking feedback, asking questions, or providing clarifications, comments foster a collaborative environment.

### Streamline Design Reviews

Facilitate efficient design reviews by using comments to highlight key aspects, address concerns, and capture feedback directly within the Designer Mode. This approach ensures that discussions are contextually tied to the design, reducing the need for external communication channels.

## How to Add Comments

You can add comments in three convenient ways, ensuring a seamless and versatile commenting experience:

1. **Comment through Toolbar:**
   Click on the comment icon in the toolbar to open a comment box instantly. This is your go-to method for quick annotations without leaving your canvas.

2. **Right-Click in Canvas:**
   Right-click on any area of your canvas, and from the contextual menu, select "Comment" or use the shortcut ***Ctrl + M (Command + M for Mac users)***. This allows for swift comment placement right where you need it.

3. **Drag comment from doc:**
   To access comment from whiteboarding doc make sure your whiteboarding feature is enabled, select comment tool from doc and drop it anywhere on canvas to comment.

## Additional Features (Coming Soon)

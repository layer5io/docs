## How to Use Comment for Design Reviews

This ensures that the right people are notified and can contribute to the discussion.

    Leave comments on specific elements within the design, whether it's a shape, text, or an entire component. This specificity ensures that feedback is targeted and directly related to the part of the design under discussion.
  
4. **Seek Approval and Finalize:**

    Once revisions are complete, use the comment feature to seek final approvals. Ensure that all team members are satisfied with the changes before finalizing the design.
  
## Best Practices for Effective Design Reviews

### 1. Be specific and actionable

Provide specific feedback rather that the design can act on. Vague comments can lead to misunderstandings and delays in the design process. Support your feedback with examples or references. This can help clarify your point and provide the designer with tangible suggestions for improvement.

### 2. Balance positive and contructive feedback

Frame feedback in a constructive manner, focusing on how things can be improved rather than just pointing out flaws. Acknowledge what works well in the design before delving into areas that need improvement. This helps maintain a positive and collaborative atmosphere.

### 3. Regularly check and respond to comments

Stay engaged in the review process. Regularly check and respond to comments to keep the conversation alive and ensure a smooth workflow.

### 4. Prioritize feedback

Highlight the most critical feedback first. This ensures that the designer focuses on the most important aspects for improvement.

## Use Kanvas for your Diagrams

{{% card header="Dev Env Documentation" %}}
The dev environment is an often overlooked but critical part of an organization's infrastructure. Knowing what clusters and services are used, how to run and test services locally, and how to troubleshoot are critical parts for getting a team up and running quickly. With Layer5, you can easily embed designs into your How To and Getting Started guides, making it easy to create, maintain and update concise documentation.

{{% card header="Migrations and Rollbacks" %}}
Migrations and rollbacks are some of the most important things to get right when they're needed. By making it easy to create, find, and reference these documents and diagrams, you can be confident that your processes will be understood and your knowledge up to date.

{{% card header="Deployment Pipeline" %}}
Layer5's keyboard shortcuts and preset icons make it easy to create beautiful, informative designs that explain every aspect of your deploy, test, and monitor pipeline. You can also use our sequence diagram-as-code feature to easily build deploy flows. Embed several in one document to cover all of your different services, vendors, and data stores.

### Use Layer5 Kanvas for all of your diagrams and docs

Beyond data flow diagrams, do you need to create other technical docs and diagrams like design docs, RFCs, network diagrams, and API diagrams? Eraser provides a single platform for modern engineering teams to collaborate on docs and diagrams.
<!-- Information in this section helps your user try your project themselves.

* What do your users need to do to start using your project? This could include downloading/installation instructions, including any prerequisites or system requirements.

* Introductory “Hello World” example, if appropriate. More complex tutorials should live in the Tutorials section.

Consider using the headings below for your getting started page. You can delete any that are not applicable to your project.

## Prerequisites

Are there any system requirements for using your project? What languages are supported (if any)? Do users need to already have any software or tools installed?

## Installation

Where can your user find your project code? How can they install it (binaries, installable package, build from source)? Are there multiple options/versions they can install and how should they choose the right one for them?

## Setup

Is there any initial setup users need to do after installation to try your project?

## Try it out!

Can your users test their installation, for example by running a command or deploying a Hello World example? -->

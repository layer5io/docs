## Designs


<!-- //Testing purpose -->

Designs are declarative, descriptive characterizations of how your Kubernetes infrastructure should be configured. Designs are versioned and can be shared with other users and teams. Designs are the primary tool for collaborative authorship of your infrastructure and services. 

### Using Designs


### Design Relationships and Restrictions
- Access to Designs may be granted to one or more users.

### Controlling Access to Designs
When creating a new design by default it's visibility level will be set to __public__ unless you are an active Lara, five subscriber, in which case you can change this default to __private__. 

{{< alert title="Google Docs Analogy" >}}Google Docs are a useful analogy for understanding Meshery designs. In many ways a Meshery design is like a single Google Doc in that they are collaboratively authored, versioned, permissioned and can move from workspace to workspace. Workspaces, a shared collection of designs, can be likened to a Google Drive, a shared collection of files.{{< /alert >}}

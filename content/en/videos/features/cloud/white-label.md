You can change the logo, color scheme, domain name, and other aspects of the user interface to match your own identity and preferences. White-labeling enables you to offer a seamless and consistent experience to your customers, partners, or internal users who access your service mesh platform. White-labeling also helps you to differentiate your platform from other Layer5 Cloud users and competitors, and to enhance your brand recognition and loyalty.

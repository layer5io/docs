**Transcript:**

Five has found that he frequently references the same set of models while designing. If you know that you’ll be using components from a model frequently, you can pin that model for easy retrieval of its components.
To pin a model to the dock in Layer5 Kanvas, click the pin icon next to the model. The model will now be accessible in the dock for quick use.

There is no limit to the number of models that you can pin to the dock.

When a model is pinned you can still browse all components or search for a specific component. Drag and drop or click to place a new component into your design.

When you no longer want a model pinned to the dock, you can remove the pin by revisiting the model in its original location and choosing to “remove from dock”.

Lessons learned in this Peer Review module:

* **Collaboration is Key:** Kanvas facilitates collaborative design through peer reviews. It emphasizes both asynchronous (commenting, notifications) and synchronous (real-time discussion) methods.
* **Clear Workflow:** The script outlines a defined workflow for peer reviews, from requesting a review to providing feedback and reaching completion.
* **Specific Feedback:** Kanvas allows users to provide feedback on specific components of a design, making the review process more targeted and effective.
* **Centralized Review:** All feedback is stored within the Kanvas design, creating a centralized location for review and discussion.
* **Benefits of Peer Review:** The script highlights the advantages of using Kanvas for peer review, such as improved collaboration, reduced errors, and faster design cycles.
* **Flexibility:** The script allows for different methods of adding comments (drag and drop, toolbar icon, hotkey, right-click) to accommodate user preferences.
* **Notifications:** Users receive notifications for review requests and comments, ensuring they stay updated.
* **Both Asynchronous and Synchronous Collaboration are Important:** The demo covers both types of interaction.

<h2 class="chapter-sub-heading">Scalable, On-demand Kubernetes Cluster</h2>

Start with a privacy-minded public cloud to host from single applications to complex architectures. Deploy a production-ready cluster in 90 seconds and manage it with a simple web portal, CLI, API or your choice of tools (Terraform).

<h2 class="chapter-sub-heading" >SKS Features</h2>

**Access to all compute instance types**

It is your cluster on your terms. Size the Node-Pools as needed, using all instance types available. Attach one Node-Pool with Memory-Optimized instances and another one with CPU-Optimized ones.

**Full cluster lifecycle management**

Kubernetes is a fast-changing platform, and versions roll out fast. SKS has built-in commands to upgrade your control plane seamlessly – minimizing downtimes and errors.

**Integration with NLB and Instance Pools**

Manage ingress traffic with Exoscale Network Load Balancer support directly integrated into SKS management. Scale pools from Kubernetes using Instance Pools.

**High-Availability control plane**

With the PRO SKS plan, benefit from a resilient HA Kubernetes control plane, so your workloads are always up.

**Simple and transparent pricing**

With a free STARTER version and an affordable PRO plan, SKS provides straightforward pricing. Nodes are charged their usual rate with no extra cluster management fee.

**All zones**

Deploy your cluster where you need to, in the region that suits your latency, privacy or redundancy strategy.

This section guides you in creating of a 3-nodes Kubernetes cluster using [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/) bootstrapping tool. This is an important step as you will use this cluster throughout this workshop.

The cluster you'll create is composed of 3 Nodes named **controlplane**, **worker1** and **worker2**. The controlplane Node runs the cluster components (API Server, Controller Manager, Scheduler, etcd), while worker1 and worker2 are the worker Nodes in charge of running the containerized workloads.

## Provisioning VMs
---

Before creating a cluster, it's necessary to provision the infrastructure (bare metal servers or virtual machines). You can create the 3 VMs on your local machine or a cloud provider (but this last option will come with a small cost). Ensure you name those VMs **controlplane**, **worker1**, and **worker2** to keep consistency alongside the workshop. Please also ensure each VM has at least 2 vCPUs and 2G of RAM so it meets the [prerequisites](https://bit.ly/kubeadm-prerequisites).

If you want to create those VMs on your local machine, we recommend using [Multipass](https://multipass.run), a tool from [Canonical](https://canonical.com/). Multipass makes creating local VMs a breeze. Once you have installed Multipass, create the VMs as follows.

```bash
multipass launch --name controlplane --memory 2G --cpus 2 --disk 10G
multipass launch --name worker1 --memory 2G --cpus 2 --disk 10G
multipass launch --name worker2 --memory 2G --cpus 2 --disk 10G
```

## Cluster initialization
---

Now that the VMs are created, you need to install some dependencies on each on them (a couple of packages including **kubectl**, **containerd** and **kubeadm**). To simplify this process we provide some scripts that will do this job for you.

First, ssh on the controlplane VM and install those dependencies using the following command.

```bash
curl https://luc.run/kubeadm/controlplane.sh | VERSION="1.32" sh
```

Next, still from the controlplane VM, initialize the cluster.

```bash
sudo kubeadm init
```

The initialization should take a few tens of seconds. The list below shows all the steps it takes.

Several commands are returned at the end of the installation process, which you'll use in the next part.

{{< image src="/images/learning-path/cka/creation/step-2.png" width="100%" align="center" alt="" >}}

## Retrieving kubeconfig file
---

The first set of commands returned during the initialization step allows configuring kubectl for the current user. Run those commands from a shell in the controlplane Node.

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

You can now list the Nodes. You'll get only one Node as you've not added the worker Nodes yet.

```bash
$ kubectl get no
NAME           STATUS     ROLES           AGE    VERSION
controlplane   NotReady   control-plane   5m4s   v1.32.4
```

## Adding the first worker Node
---

As you've done for the controlplane, use the following command to install the dependencies (kubectl, containerd, kubeadm) on worker1.

```bash
curl https://luc.run/kubeadm/worker.sh | VERSION="1.32" sh
```

Then, run the join command returned during the initialization step. This command allows you to add worker nodes to the cluster.

```bash
sudo kubeadm join 10.81.0.174:6443 --token kolibl.0oieughn4y03zvm7 \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:a1d26efca219428731be6b62e3298a2e5014d829e51185e804f2f614b70d933d
```

## Adding the second worker Node
---

You need to do the same on worker2. First, install the dependencies.

```bash
curl https://luc.run/kubeadm/worker.sh | VERSION="1.32" sh
```

Then, run the join command to add this Node to the cluster.

```bash
sudo kubeadm join 10.81.0.174:6443 --token kolibl.0oieughn4y03zvm7 \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:a1d26efca219428731be6b62e3298a2e5014d829e51185e804f2f614b70d933d
```

You now have cluster with 3 Nodes.

{{< image src="/images/learning-path/cka/creation/step-3.png" width="100%" align="center" alt="" >}}

## Status of the Nodes
---

List the Nodes and notice they are all in NotReady status.

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME            STATUS     ROLES           AGE     VERSION
controlplane    NotReady   control-plane   9m58s   v1.32.4
worker1         NotReady   <none>          58s     v1.32.4
worker2         NotReady   <none>          55s     v1.32.4
```

If you go one step further and describe the controlplane Node, you'll get why the cluster is not ready yet.

```
â€¦
KubeletNotReady              container runtime network not ready: NetworkReady=false reason:NetworkPluginNotReady message:Network plugin returns error: cni plugin not initialized
```

## Installing a network plugin
---

Run the following commands from the controlplane Node to install Cilium in your cluster.

```bash
OS="$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"
ARCH="$(uname -m | sed -e 's/x86_64/amd64/' -e 's/\(arm\)\(64\)\?.*/\1\2/' -e 's/aarch64$/arm64/')"
curl -L --remote-name-all https://github.com/cilium/cilium-cli/releases/latest/download/cilium-$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz{,.sha256sum}
sudo tar xzvfC cilium-$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz /usr/local/bin
cilium install
```

After a few tens of seconds, you'll see your cluster is ready.

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME            STATUS   ROLES           AGE     VERSION
controlplane    Ready    control-plane   13m     v1.32.4
worker1         Ready    <none>          4m28s   v1.32.4
worker2         Ready    <none>          4m25s   v1.32.4
```

## Get the kubeconfig on the host machine
---

To avoid connecting to the controlplane Node to run the kubectl commands, copy the kubeconfig file from the controlplane to the host machine. Make sure to copy this file into `$HOME/.kube/config` so it automatically configures kubectl.

If you've created your VMs with Multipass, you can copy the kubeconfig file using the following commands.

```bash
multipass transfer controlplane:/home/ubuntu/.kube/config config
mkdir $HOME/.kube
mv config $HOME/.kube/config
```

You should now be able to direcly list the Nodes from the host machine.

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME            STATUS   ROLES           AGE     VERSION
controlplane    Ready    control-plane   13m     v1.32.4
worker1         Ready    <none>          4m28s   v1.32.4
worker2         Ready    <none>          4m25s   v1.32.4
```

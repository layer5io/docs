## Use Deployments in the VotingApp

1. In the *votingapp* directory, replace each Pod specification with a Deployment specification with a single replica. Name these Deployment files *deploy-XXX.yaml* where XXX is the name of the microservice (*voteui*, *vote*, ...)

2. Deploy the application defined by these specifications

3. Access the vote and result interfaces via NodePort Services

4. Delete a Pod. What happens ?

5. Delete the application

            name: result-ui
  ```





2. Deploy the application with the following command from the *votingapp* directory:

```bash
kubectl apply -f .
```

3. As before, using the IP address of one of the cluster nodes, you can access the vote and result interfaces via ports *31000* and *31001* respectively.

{{< image src="/images/learning-path/intro-kubernetes/resources/deployment/practice/result.png" align="center" width="100%" alt="Results" >}}

4. Each Pod is now managed by a Deployment. If a Pod is deleted, another Pod is automatically created to replace it.

List of Pods:
```bash
$ kubectl get po
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db-647c8f548b-j7z79          1/1     Running   0          3m35s
redis-6f95f75d56-7gwjz       1/1     Running   0          3m35s
result-7f897b4d58-qqtt4      1/1     Running   0          3m35s
result-ui-5cdd74d999-q5tx7   1/1     Running   0          3m34s
vote-6c847fd45-fpprh         1/1     Running   0          3m35s
vote-ui-74849dd9b4-gwcq9     1/1     Running   0          3m35s
worker-8655654586-k44vw      1/1     Running   0          3m35s
```

Deleting a Pod (e.g., *worker*):

```bash
$ kubectl delete po worker-8655654586-k44vw 
pod "worker-8655654586-k44vw" deleted
```

A new Pod is automatically launched to replace the one that was deleted.

```bash
$ kubectl get po                                 
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db-647c8f548b-j7z79          1/1     Running   0          5m15s
redis-6f95f75d56-7gwjz       1/1     Running   0          5m15s
result-7f897b4d58-qqtt4      1/1     Running   0          5m15s
result-ui-5cdd74d999-q5tx7   1/1     Running   0          5m14s
vote-6c847fd45-fpprh         1/1     Running   0          5m15s
vote-ui-74849dd9b4-gwcq9     1/1     Running   0          5m15s
worker-8655654586-mmzgh      1/1     Running   0          4s
```

A Deployment ensures that Pods are always present. If we had deleted a Pod that was not managed by a Deployment (a *Naked Pod*), no new Pod would be automatically created to replace it.

5. We delete the application with the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete -f .
```

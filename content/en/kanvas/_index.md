**Layer5 Cloud** ([docs](/cloud)) is an identity provider and global console for Meshery deployments with an extensible and highly flexible authorization framework, tenant entitlement services, service provider-grade organizational hierarchy, team workspace management and a content catalog for public and private hosting of cloud native architectures. Layer5 Cloud is available as a service or self-hosted.

## What is Kanvas?

<p style="display:flex;text-align:center;margin:1rem auto;color:white;"><i>Kanvas is like Google Docs for DevOps, as it allows you to create, test, and deploy cloud native architectures collaboratively and easily.</i></p>

Kanvas is a web-based application that allows you to create and share diagrams of cloud native infrastructure for Kubernetes. You can draw shapes, lines, text, and icons to represent the components and relationships of your Kubernetes clusters. Kanvas supports freestyle design, meaning that you can customize the appearance and layout of your diagrams without any constraints. Kanvas also enables real-time collaboration, meaning that you can invite others to join your sessions and edit the diagrams together. Kanvas is a simple and intuitive tool for designing and communicating cloud native infrastructure for Kubernetes and multi-cloud services.

<!-- ## What is Kanvas?

Introduce your project, including what it does or lets you do, why you would use it, and its primary goal (and how it achieves it). This should be similar to your README description, though you can go into a little more detail here if you want.

## Why do I want it?

Help your user know if your project will help them. Useful information can include:

* **What is it good for?**: What types of problems does your project solve? What are the benefits of using it?

* **What is it not good for?**: For example, point out situations that might intuitively seem suited for your project, but aren't for some reason. Also mention known limitations, scaling issues, or anything else that might let your users know if the project is not for them.

* **What is it *not yet* good for?**: Highlight any useful features that are coming soon.

## Where should I go next?

Give your users next steps from the Overview. For example:

* [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/): Get started with $project
* [Examples](/docs/examples/): Check out some example code!

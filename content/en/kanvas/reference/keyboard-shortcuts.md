### Searching for Components

Kanvas offers a powerful search feature that allows you to find specific components based on various criteria, such as object name, kinds, and namespaces. Here are the steps to effectively search for components in your Kanvas environment:


1. Start typing your search query, such as the object name, kinds, or namespaces you're interested in. As you type, Kanvas will dynamically filter and display components that match your criteria.

2. By clicking on a keyword or component in the search results, you can further filter out the components to focus on specific items.

This search functionality makes it easy to quickly locate and access the components you need in your Kanvas environment.

----------------

Tables should have bold headings and alternating shaded rows.

| Artist            | Album           | Year |
|-------------------|-----------------|------|
| Michael Jackson   | Thriller        | 1982 |
| Prince            | Purple Rain     | 1984 |
| Beastie Boys      | License to Ill  | 1986 |

If a table is too wide, it should scroll horizontally.

| Artist            | Album           | Year | Label       | Awards   | Songs     |
|-------------------|-----------------|------|-------------|----------|-----------|

----------------

Code snippets like `var foo = "bar";` can be shown inline.

Also, `this should vertically align` ~~`with this`~~ ~~and this~~.

Code can also be shown in a block element.

```
foo := "bar";
bar := "foo";
```

Code can also use syntax highlighting.

```go
func main() {
  input := `var foo = "bar";`

  lexer := lexers.Get("javascript")
  iterator, _ := lexer.Tokenise(nil, input)
  style := styles.Get("github")
  formatter := html.New(html.WithLineNumbers())

  var buff bytes.Buffer
  formatter.Format(&buff, style, iterator)

  fmt.Println(buff.String())
}
```

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

Inline code inside table cells should still be distinguishable.

| Language    | Code               |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Javascript  | `var foo = "bar";` |
| Ruby        | `foo = "bar"{`      |

----------------

Small images should be shown at their actual size.

Large images should always scale down and fit in the content container.
